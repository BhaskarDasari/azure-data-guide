# Cognitive Services
Microsoft cognitive services are cloud-based APIs that you can leverage in artificial intelligence (AI) applications and data flows.
The cognitive services are developed by Microsoft's AI and Research team, and leverage the latest deep learning algorithms. They are consumed over HTTP REST interfaces, and software development kits (SDKs) for many common application development frameworks are available.

The cognitive services include services for:
* Text analysis
* Computer vision
* Video analytics
* Speech recognition and generation
* Natural language understanding
* Intelligent search

Key Benefits:
* Minimal development effort for state-of-the-art AI services.
* Easy integration into apps via HTTP REST interfaces
* Built-in support for consuming cognitive services in Azure Data Lake Analytics

Considerations:
* Only available over the Web - Internet connectivity is required.
* Although considerable customization is supported, the available services may not suit all predictive analytics requirements.
