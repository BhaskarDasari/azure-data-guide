# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a technique used to train predictive models based on statistical algorithms that leverage relationships between data fields to predict unknown values.

The process of creating a deploying machine learning models is an iterative one, in which:
* Data scientists explore the source data to determine relationships between its *features* and the required predicted *labels*.
* The data scientists train and validate models based on appropriate algorithms to find the optimal model for prediction.
* The optimal model is deployed into production - often as a web service or some other encapsulated function.
* As new data is collected, the model is periodically retrained to improve is effectiveness.

## Model Preparation and Training
During the model preparation and training phase, data scientists explore the data interactively using languages like Python and R to:
* Extract samples from high volume enterprise data stores
* Find and treat outliers, duplicates, and missing values to clean the data
* Determine correlations and relationships in the data through statistical analysis and visualization.
* Apply *feature engineering* techniques to generate new calculated features that improve the predictiveness of statistical relationships.
* Train machine learning models based on predictive algorithms.
* Validate trained models using data that was witheld during training.

To support this interactive analysis and modeling phase, the enterprise ecosystem must enable data scientists to access data using the tools they need to explore it. Additionally, the training of a complex machine learning model can require a lot of intensive processing of high volumes of data, so sufficient resources for scaling out the model training is essential.

## Model Deployment and Consumption
When a model is ready to be deployed, it can be encapsulated as a web service and deployed in the cloud, to an edge device, or within an enterprise machine learning execution evironment.
